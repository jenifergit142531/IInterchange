Introduction :

API => Application programming interface 

Intermediate software that handles the request and response in various clients  
(mobile,laptop,desktop)

Web service :

-Software that runs on diff platform and interact with multiple machines to share the data

Implementation :

- WCF - Windows communication foundation 

- SOAP - Simple object access protocol

=> Create a web service 
=> Understand XML Format 
=> <></>
=> Returns xml data
=> write the code in markup<tag> format
<soapenvelop>
<soapheader>.hjdhfwgk</soapheader>
<soapbody>khagdlkdq</soapbody>
<soapfault>jvfdakhdfl</soapfault>
<soapenvelop>

- REST

* Architectural style to create web api
* Representational state transfer

REST Principles

1.Statelessness

- each request is independent and does not rely on previous request

2.Client server architecture

- Seperation of concern 

3.Uniform Interface 

- Resource Identification and manipulation

4.Cacheability

- Frquently accessed resources/ pages stored on cache

5.Layered System

-  RESTful system has many layers - logic , model

6.Code On Demand(Optional)

- it allows server to provide executable code (eg.js) to the client.
- optional one
- it should be enough to sent response rather than code 

REST vs RESTFUL Services :

REST : Set of rules / principles

RESTFUL Service : applications that you create following thoses REST priciples

REST API :

- http request & http response
- easy to implement
- supports HTTP Verbs

HTTP Methods \ Verbs :

HTTPPOST   - CREATE
HTTPGET    - READ
HTTPPUT    - UPDATE
HTTPDELETE - DELETE

Protocol = http ,https
Testing = Postman / fiddler /swagger

- HTTP Status codes 

* Response body of the web api 

100 - Informational
200 - Success
300 - Redirectional / dependency
400 - Client side error
500 - Server side error

- Data binding :

* Binds model to controller

Routing : Navigating from one page to another page


-------------------------CORE ASPMVC ------------------------------

Globalization & Localization :

Globalization : Process of designing the web page that support different culture
- Add support to input ,display,output must be related to specific geographic location

Localization : Process of adapting to the global size

- specific culture / locale information while creating the application

Internalization : Support globalization & Localization
