Agenda :

- Arrays
* single dimensional
* multi dimentional
* Jagged array
- Property
- Indexers
- tuples
- records

Arrays:

- collection of data of same data type
- reference type
- Indexes are used to access the array elements
- index starts with 0

Types :
* single dimensional
* multi dimentional
* Jagged array

Advantages :

- Contiguous memory allocation
- Easy to access

Disadvantage :

- fixed size (declare the size and then initialize)
- Resource wastage
- insertion / deletion is difficult

Property :

- member of a class that encapsulates the state of the object

- Control the access to the data fields

get {} - retrieve the value
set {} - set the value

Why ??

- Validate
- Control the access
- Data transformation 

Indexers :

- Virtual array / smart array
- c# 8.0
- this keyword
- [] : access
- set / get property in indexing

Advantage :

easy access to elements

Tuple  :

- Introduced in c# 7.0
- store data of different data types
- Light weight
- Used for temporary data grouping 

Record :

- Introduced in c# 9.0
- Reference data type
- Immutable object
- Properties cannot be changed
- get & init
- "with" keyword to update the property value 

Unmanaged code : Code directly executed by the OS

- does not have CLR support

- unsafe
