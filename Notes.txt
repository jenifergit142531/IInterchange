- Razor pages / view
- State management 
- custom Middleware


Razor pages : both client + server syntax

@{

} - Razor syntax


cshtml ---> cs + html

Razor view : pass the data from the controller to the view 

Viewbag : Container 
- does not care for the data type

ViewData :
- Check for the datatype,cast the required type before using it


State management :

- Preserve the state of the webpage / object/ data / application values 

Client side : happens in the browser / client computer

Server side : stores the data in the server side


Client side SM :

1.Cookies
2.Query String
3.Hidden field
4.View data
5.View Bag
6.Temp Data

Server side SM :

Session

Why we need state management ??

- HTTP - Hyper text transfer protocol

- By default it is stateless

https://localhost:7122/


Cookie : 

Stores the data in the browser
- Please do not save any sensitive data on the cookie

Query String :

when you pass data from one page to another page over the URL

?


https://localhost:7122/query/displaydata?name=fera

employee/edit/100

Hidden Field :

- Hide your data on the client
- It is available on the page source , but not visible on the browers
- Good to use for sensitive data


Temp Data : 

-  RedirectToAction

Session SM:

- Store the data in server side
- Associated with every web page
- Log out / expires / time out if the session is unused for sometime 


Aspnetcore.session
