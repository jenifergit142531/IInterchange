Agenda :

- Delegates
* Single cast
* Multicast
- Anonymous delegate
- Generic delegate
- Built in Delegates
* Func
* Action
* Predicate
- Lambda Expression
- Events
- Event Handling


Delegate :

- Reference type
- Type safe pointer
- hold the references to the method
- Many delegates in your class
- Delegates work well with lambda expression and anonymous method

Need ?
- Call back to the method at run time.
- Invoke the event

Three step process 

Step 1 : Declare the delegate 

<accessmodifier> delegate <returntype> <delegatename>(parameter)

Step 2 : Set the target method 

delegatename dn=new delegatename(method)

Step 3 : Invocation (resolved at runtime)

dn()

Types :

- Single cast :  1delegate--> 1 method

- Multicast delegate : 1d--> many methods 

+= operator to multicast multiple methods to a single delegate


Generic Delegate :

T - datatype

delegate must work with different method signature

Anonymous delegate :

- delegate has no method
- no formal name / definition for your method
- method is defined inline
- Short,simple  delegate

Built in delegates :

- func :

* MUST return a value
* 0 - 16 input parameters
* does not allow ref / out parameters
* anonymous functions & lambda expressions

lambda expression :

* => 

input => expression

- action

* does not return a value
* return type is void
* accept 0 - 16 input parameters
* anonymous functions & lambda expressions

- predicate
