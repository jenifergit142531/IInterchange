Agenda :

- Transaction

* Unit of work that is performed in the database
* sequence of work is accomplished in a logical order
* Eg : Online food delivery -- swiggy , zomato,zepto...

inconsistency of data :

user ---> request(adding items to cart)
user ----> initiate payment(zepto)----->wallet(upi - phonepy,gpay...)
user <-----wait(zepto to confirm)<-----wallet
user<-----wallet(debited)


money debited , order not confirmed ===> bad transaction  , complete failure(reert the money back to the user)
money debited , order confirmed => successful transaction

Properties of transaction : ACID   ==> Good transaction

1.Atomicity - ensures all work is done or none is done

2.Consistency - ensures db changes states upon successful transaction

3.Isolation - all transaction should be independent of each other

4.Durability - ensures the result of commited transaction persist in case of any failure

Types :

- Autocommit transaction - default one
- Implicit : start the transaction and end the transaction with commit / rollback
- Explicit : starting and ending for the transaction


Locks 

- Exclusive lock
- shared lock
- update lock
- intent lock
- schema lock
- bulk update lock

* can be applied row ,database,table,page
